easy, construct a dict of character to index, compare each word, find diff, check whether diffs are reasonable.

If no diff, check length

class Solution:
    def isAlienSorted(self, words: List[str], order: str) -> bool:
        index = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(order)}
        for i in range(1, len(words)):
            cur, pre = words[i], words[i - 1]
            diff = None
            for j in range(min(len(cur), len(pre))):
                if cur[j] != pre[j]:
                    diff = j
                    break
            
            if diff is None and len(cur) < len(pre):
                    return False
            elif index[cur[diff]] < index[pre[diff]]:
                    return False
        return True
